# Coding Diary  

Month 1 - 06/03/2025
Who Am I and Why Am I Doing This?
Hello, World! My name is Pedro Caçador Pochyly da Costa, and I am learning Python! I
also want to get better at English — writing and speaking — and that’s why I started
this Coding Diary. It’s a place to talk about my progress and practice both things
at the same time.

A little about me: I have a bachelor’s degree in Economics from UNB (University of
Brasília), one of the top 5 universities in Brazil. When I started studying economics,
I wasn’t sure if it was the right choice for me. I didn’t know what I really liked.
But then I took classes in Statistics, Mathematics, and Econometrics, and I worked
in junior and senior consultancies. These experiences made me more interested in
numbers and data. That’s how I found Data Analysis, and now I am here learning
programming languages.

I said this is my “first day” with Python, but it’s not exactly true. I started 4-5
months ago when the company where I have an internship bought a course called
“Código.py.” It was my first time with coding, and I liked it! I took notes, did
exercises, and learned how to write simple programs. But after a few weeks, I
stopped. I lost motivation because it was hard to study alone, and I had a lot of
work at my internship. Some time passed, and my interest came back stronger. I
looked online and saw that Python, with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and others,
can help me analyze data faster and better. That’s why I decided to try again!

Now, I am studying the basics of NumPy. Before that, I spent time learning the first
steps of Python — things like variables, loops, and functions. It took me a few
weeks to understand everything, but I did many exercises to practice (you can see
them in the “Lógica de Programação” folder). Sometimes it’s difficult, especially
when I make mistakes and don’t know why the code doesn’t work. But when I fix it,
I feel happy! I want to use Python for my internship soon, maybe to help with some
reports or data from the company.

Month 2 - 07/03/2025
Back with News!
Hello, guys! One month passed, and I am here again to tell you what I learned, what
I did, and what I want to do next. It’s been a busy time, but I am excited to share
everything! First, in the “Código.py” course, I finished the Pandas module! I did
about 40 exercises to learn its functions — things like reading files, cleaning
data, and making tables (you can find them in the Course Folder).

I think I know what Pandas can do now, but I still forget some syntax when I write code. For
example, I mix up how to use iloc and loc sometimes, and I need to check my
notes to remember. It’s not a big problem — I just need more practice. One thing I
liked learning was how to use groupby() to analyze data in groups. I tested it
with a small dataset from my internship about sales, and it showed me how sales
change by month. It’s very useful for economics! Now, I am studying the Matplotlib
module, and I really like it! Making graphs is fun and helps me see data in a new
way. 

I started with simple things, like bar charts and line graphs. Yesterday, I
made a line graph that shows changes in data when I move the mouse over it — it’s
interactive, and I learned how to add this with a function called mplcursors. It
took me two hours to make it work, but it was worth it! I used fake data about
prices, but I want to try it with real data soon. Another thing I did was a bar
chart to compare sales from different stores. It looked good, and I showed it to
my boss at the internship. He said it’s interesting! 

Also, I made a project that reads brokerage notes and calculates average asset prices. 
It was challenging, but I managed to finish it this month using Pandas to process the data. 
Next, I have some plans. I want to finish the Matplotlib module this month and start
learning Scikit-learn after that. I heard it’s good for machine learning, and I
want to try it because my internship has a project about predicting sales. Also,
I am thinking about a small project: using Pandas and Matplotlib together to make
a report with tables and graphs for my company. Maybe I can add some colors and
save it as a PDF file to show my team. I don’t know if it will work yet, but I will
try! I will write here again to tell you how it goes.
