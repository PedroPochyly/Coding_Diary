#Coding Diary  

## Day 1 - 06/03/2025

 - Who am i and why im doing this?

Hello World! My name is Pedro Caçador Pochyly da Costa and im trying to learn python! Furthermore, besides coding, im trying to improve my English whriting and speaking, thats the hole point why i created this Coding Diary!

Without getting too deep into my history, im a bacherlors degree in economics, at UNB (University of Brasília), one of the best (top 5) Universities in Brazil! at the start of my jurney in economics, i wasn´t very sure if i would preceed, because i did not know if th_
at was what i was realy into to. Althouth, overtime,learning/studyng statistics, Mathematics, Econometrics and working on Junior and Senior Consultancies i became more and more interested on the subjects, leading me to Data Analysis and consequently to programming leangua_
ges.

Althought i stated this as my first day trying to code in python that couldn´t be further from the truth, that´s because i started this jurney approximately 5-4 Months ago when the company where i have an internship bought a python course called ''Codigo.py''. Therefore, i
became realy intrested in this subject and started doing it, taking notes, doing exercises... But, after some short weeks i dropped it, thats because my lack of motivation hited hard. After some time, my intrest came back and after looking around and doing some research i
found out that python and some librarys could help me a lot on my journey!

So, im currently learning the basics of Numpy, after a long way to realy understand and practice the Basics of Pyhon, (you can see my progress and exercises of this step on the folder called ''Lógica de Programação''.
